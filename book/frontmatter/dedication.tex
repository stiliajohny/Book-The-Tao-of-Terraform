{\Large\textit{Dedication}}\\[3cm]

\begin{em}
To the architects of boundless digital realms,\\
the visionaries who transmute code into creation,\\
and the audacious engineers of tomorrow.\\[2em]

To those who understand that every line of code\\
is a covenant with the future,\\
each resource a testament to possibility.\\[2em]

And to all who embrace Terraform's creed,\\
recognizing its methodology as more than a tool,\\
but a revolution in the art of Infrastructure as Code.\\[2em]

May these words ignite your passion,\\
as you traverse the formidable realm of Terraform,\\
where raw chaos is sculpted into order,\\
and the digital landscape is reborn through your command.\\[3em]

% Extra space before personal dedication

{\small
And most importantly,\\
To my partner in life Beatriz,\\
for her patience and support\\
and for being my best friend,\\
strongest critic, and most trusted confidant.}
